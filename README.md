Some torn.com API key functions with python

# How to install:

### **Python**:
You will need to install the [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/ "requests") library, by typing in your console:

`pip install requests`


# How to use:
It will ask you for your API key, that you can find [here](https://www.torn.com/preferences.php#tab=api)

Then it will autosave it in a apikey.txt file.

If the apikey is wrong, the program will reset and ask for an API key once again.

You can ask for multiple fields at a time, for example:

`ammo, profile, logs`
